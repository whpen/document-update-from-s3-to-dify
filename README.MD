S3 to Dify Knowledge Sync Lambda Function
This tool is an AWS Lambda function designed to synchronize files from a specific AWS S3 bucket to the Dify Knowledge repository.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

AWS CLI configured with the appropriate permissions.
Node.js (version 18.x) installed.
Access to the Dify backend and its VPC.
Instructions
1. Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project directory and run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

npm install
2. Create Deployment Package
Create a ZIP file containing your lambda_function.js and the node_modules folder. This ZIP file will be used to deploy the Lambda function.

3. Create AWS Lambda Function
Create an AWS Lambda function with the following key configurations:

Runtime: Node.js 18.x
VPC: Same as your Dify backend
4. Upload Deployment Package
Upload the ZIP file created in step 2 to your AWS Lambda function.

5. Configure Lambda Function
Ensure the following configurations are set for your Lambda function:

Handler: lambda_function.handler
Execution Role: Ensure your Lambda function has the necessary permissions to process the S3 bucket. In the execution role, add the relevant policy to allow S3 access.
6. Set Environment Variables
Set the required environment variables in the AWS Lambda function. Refer to env.example and the Dify documentation for the necessary environment variables.

Example env.example
S3_BUCKET_NAME=your-s3-bucket-name
DIFY_API_KEY=your-dify-api-key
DIFY_ENDPOINT=your-dify-endpoint
Ensure these variables are correctly set in your Lambda function's configuration.

Additional Notes
Regularly check and update the dependencies to keep the Lambda function secure.
Monitor the Lambda function logs through AWS CloudWatch for any errors or issues.
Adjust the Lambda function settings based on your performance requirements and AWS Lambda best practices.
